REQUIRED Features

    Display data from a database via multiple interactive pages.
    The data involved must be complex data. Rather than just displaying a list of employee names, a good example of complex data would be a list of employee names, and when each is selected, the system would display an employee's name, title, address, salary, etc.
    Allow the user to edit data in the database.

    Please have a look.
